Most Claude Code sessions follow this sequence:

1. `/gather-context` to have Claude get his bearings.
2. `/session-report` to create a session report with commit log, unresolved/resolved/triages issues, compact-resilient session context, human notes.
3. `/create-plan` → `/audit p` → `/execute-plan` to write, verify, and implement solutions.
4. `/audit` → `/resolve` to catch issues.
5. `/document`to preserve valuable context in the project reference directory.
